We have used Navie Bayes Algorithm to train the model and we will be tesing the model by giving the inputs from the dataset.

# Features
1. Django-Powered Web Application: The project is built using Django, providing a robust and scalable framework for implementing the network intrusion detection system.
2. Naive Bayes Classification: Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm, a powerful probabilistic classifier, to analyze network traffic and predict potential intrusions.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The web application features an intuitive interface where users can input network data, run predictions, and view results, similar to the visual style in the image provided.
4. Real-Time Detection: The system is designed to integrate with real-time network monitoring tools, offering immediate analysis and detection of potential threats.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: [[Network-Intrusion-Detection](https://github.com/Manoj-412/Network-Intrusion-Detection.git)]
2. Set up the required environment by installing Python, Django, and necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas).
3. Train the Naive Bayes model using a dataset of network traffic to prepare the system for accurate predictions.
4. Run the Django server and access the web interface to begin detecting network intrusions based on user input.
